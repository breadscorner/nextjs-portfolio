# TravelMeet üåç‚úàÔ∏è

## Project Overview

TravelMeet is an innovative platform tailored for travelers, enabling real-time interaction and exploration of events and places. Crafted with a robust tech stack including Node, Express, and more, it offers a unique way for users to connect, share locations, and discover events.

### Features

- **Real-time Location Sharing:**
  - Users can see the locations of other users and events live on the map, enhancing interaction and coordination.

- **User Profiles:**
  - Engage with community members by viewing profiles, following users, and connecting with travelers sharing similar interests.

- **Event Discovery:**
  - Leverage the Ticketmaster API to discover and plan attendance at local events, based on user location preferences.

- **Group Creation:**
  - Facilitate social interactions and event planning by allowing users to create and join groups.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Ensure a seamless user experience across various devices, maintaining functionality and aesthetics.

## Personal Motivation

Developing TravelMeet was an opportunity to create a meaningful tool for travelers that integrates real-time data and geographic information systems. It provided me with:
- A chance to implement advanced JavaScript frameworks and libraries to solve real-world problems.
- Experience in managing live user data and interactions using Socket.IO for real-time web applications.
- The ability to enhance user experience with responsive design practices and modern JavaScript techniques.

## Tech Stack

### Backend:
- **Node:** Facilitates the server-side logic and integration with various APIs and databases.
- **Express:** Streamlines server setup and routes management for efficient API handling.

### Real-time Interactivity:
- **Socket.IO:** Manages real-time communication between clients and servers.

### Geographic Data Handling:
- **Mapbox GL JS:** Renders interactive maps.
- **Turf.js:** Performs advanced geographic data analysis.

### Database and ORM:
- **MySQL:** Stores user and event data.
- **Prisma ORM:** Simplifies database management with robust object-relational mapping.

### Frontend:
- **Vanilla JS:** Manages client-side logic and interactions without additional frameworks.
- **EJS:** Templating engine to render HTML views dynamically.

### Styling:
- **Tailwind CSS:** Provides utility-first CSS components for rapid UI development.

### Storage and Authentication:
- **AWS S3 Object Storage:** Stores user-generated content securely and scalably.
- **Passport.js:** Handles user authentication processes.

## Project Summary:

TravelMeet integrates modern web technologies to provide a real-time, interactive platform for travelers. The use of Socket.IO and Mapbox GL JS enhances user experience by offering dynamic location tracking and map interactions. Future enhancements could include more personalized event recommendations using machine learning and improved security features for user data and interactions.

In this project, I further developed my skills in managing live interactions and handling geographical data efficiently. The next steps would include refining the user interface and expanding the platform‚Äôs capabilities to support more personalized user experiences.
